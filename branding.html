Most home decor brands cater the designs of their goods to the bohemian artisanal aesthetic. I wanted to design a logo animation, upholstery fabric swatches, silverware designs, dishware designs, and tile flooring designs. I used a 3D rendering program to create digital versions of my designs and then compiled my renderings and logo animation into a retail website.</p></div></div>

        <div class="img"><div id="ii"><h3>South Walton Utility Logo Redesign</h3><p style="width: 60%;">The South Walton Utility logo redesign was one of the first jobs I took on as a freelance designer. The company is a water resource partner on the Gulf Coast that focuses on water treatment and conservation. In the previous version of their logo, there was a waterdrop and blue, green, and purple waves representing the drinking water, golf courses, and sewer treatment plants. For the new logo, I kept the water drop and the colors to keep the familiarity of the company.</p></div><img style="clear:both; text-align:right;" src="images/swuciapparel.jpg" height=400px ></div>
