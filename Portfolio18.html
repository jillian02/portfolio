        <h3> 68th Annual Youth Art Focus </h3>
    
    <h2>
       While working with the <a href="https://pensacolamuseum.org/" class="external">Pensacola Museum of Art</a> as a client during my internship, I was in charge of designing the exhibition identity of the <a href="https://pensacolamuseum.org/art/68th-annual-youth-art-focus/" class="external">68th Annual Youth Art Focus exhibit</a>. Youth Art Focus is an annual juried exhibition in partnership with Escambia County School District and the PMA Guild showcasing all Escambia County School art classes. After the submitted work was juried, I was responsible for designing award certificates and inputting the names I received in a list from the judges. There were multiple requirements to meet for the award certificates, such as logo use and spacing for signatures.
