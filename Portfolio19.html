        <h3> 68th Annual Youth Art Focus </h3>
    
    <h2>
       While working with the <a href="https://pensacolamuseum.org/" class="external">Pensacola Museum of Art</a> as a client during my internship, I was in charge of designing the exhibition identity of the <a href="https://pensacolamuseum.org/art/68th-annual-youth-art-focus/" class="external">68th Annual Youth Art Focus exhibit</a>. Youth Art Focus is an annual juried exhibition in partnership with Escambia County School District and the PMA Guild showcasing all Escambia County School art classes. In addition to award certificates, I was also in charge of designing award buttons to help add a more interactive element for students whose work was selected for an award. Each media had an award category and I represented this through the color of the buttons. For the more overarching awards like Best in Show and Outstanding Achievement, I mirrored the title wall design in the button design. I then helped print, cut out, and assemble the buttons for distribution to the students.
