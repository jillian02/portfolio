        <h3> If I Cannot Fly</h3>
    
    <h2>
        One of the clients I had during my internship was the <a href="https://uwf.edu/cassh/departments/dr-grier-williams-school-of-music/" class="external" target="_blank">Dr. Grier Williams School of Music.</a> Each year the school selects a faculty member who will have a soloist recital. I was directed by the Director of UWF Center for Fine and Performing Arts to design the poster advertising the faculty recital for 2022. I was provided an image of the faculty member and was asked to edit the image in Adobe Photoshop so it could be incorporated into the poster through Adobe Illustrator. Because darker values are difficult to print, I conducted two test prints to ensure accurate tones in the final prints for distribution.</h2>
