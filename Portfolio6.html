        <h3>Coastal Art Museum of St. Augustine</h3>
    
    <h2>
        In one of my first graphic design courses, I was paired with another student to create a concept for a new museum and design a brand and exhibition identity for the museum. Our plan of action was to design a brand identity together and then divide the remaining deliverables for the exhibition identity between the two of us. My partner and I also created a weekly schedule to help with the time management of all of the deliverables. One of my responsibilities was a banner design for the exhibition. I created a mockup of my banner designs to show the scaling ratio between text and imagery.
