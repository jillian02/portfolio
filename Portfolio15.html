        <h3>In Place: Faculty Exhibition</h3>
    
    <h2>
        The first experience I had working with a client during my internship was with the <a href="https://uwf.edu/cassh/departments/art-and-design/art-gallery/" class="external" target="_blank">University of West Florida Art Gallery</a>. Each year the school’s Department of Art and Design presents a faculty exhibition. The faculty exhibition for 2021 was the first exhibition the gallery held since its closing due to COVID-19. I was partnered with another student in my internship to design the exhibition identity for the 2021 Faculty Exhibition under the supervision of the UWF Art Gallery Director. With my partner’s title wall design approved, I went on to design the poster and postcard for the exhibition based on her design. The poster went through multiple revisions as more information was decided about the reception and whether COVID policies would allow refreshments. Once final approval was granted, I oversaw the printing process.
