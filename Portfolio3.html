        <h3> Jazz Ensemble Posters</h3>
    
    <h2>
        In working with the <a href="https://uwf.edu/cassh/departments/dr-grier-williams-school-of-music/" class="external">Dr. Grier Williams School of Music.</a>, I was also in charge of designing a series of posters advertising the UWF Jazz Ensemble and Combo group performances for the 2021-2022 academic year. The series consisted of five different posters for five different performances. There were two performances in February that would be displayed at the same time. So for this month, I changed the background design of one of the posters to resemble a stage layout rather than the window layout from previous posters in the series.
