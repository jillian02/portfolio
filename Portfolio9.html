        <h3> Unplug Yourself Campaign</h3>
    
    <h2>
        Most of my work from school has to do with campaigning and poster designs. A few semesters into school I was asked to design a poster series for an advocacy topic. I was given a few topics to choose from and decided on social media addiction as my topic. There were five different deliverables for the assignment that included designs for posters, Instagram posts, Twitter banners, Facebook headers, and an infographic. There is a robotic, science-fiction theme throughout my designs to depict the strong ties to social media addiction. The bright colors and cool textures help draw attention to the posters.
