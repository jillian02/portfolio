        <h3> Mira on the Wall </h3>
    
    <h2>
       One of my final studio courses was based on the creation and completion of a semester-long design project. The project was student lead but I received weekly feedback from the professor and student peers. My project was a design solution to the narrow markets of home decor brands and companies. Most home decor brands cater the designs of their goods to the bohemian artisanal aesthetic. Not many companies target their designs to the more dramatic and maximalist aesthetics. I created a home decor brand called <a href="https://jip106.wixsite.com/mira-on-the-wall" class="external">Mira On the Wall</a> and designed a brand campaign and identity for the company. I set a weekly schedule to stay on track with all of the deliverables I wanted to design like a logo animation, upholstery fabric swatches, silverware designs, dishware designs, and tile flooring designs. I used a 3D rendering program to create digital versions of my designs that would be sold as physical items. I then compiled my product renderings and my logo animation into a mock-up retail website for the company.
