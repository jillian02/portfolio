        <h3>Synthesis BFA Exit Show</h3>
    
    <h2>
        Two of the clients I had during my internship were the <a href="https://pensacolamuseum.org/" class="external" target="_blank">Pensacola Museum of Art</a> and the <a href="https://uwf.edu/cassh/departments/art-and-design/art-gallery/" class="external" target="_blank">University of West Florida Art Gallery</a>. Each fall and spring semester, the PMA and UWF Art Galleries come together to present SynThesis, a group BFA Exit Exhibition. I was paired with another student in the internship to design the exhibition identities for the 2021 fall SynThesis 2022 spring SynThesis. I was under the direction of the PMAâ€™s Director, Chief Curator, and Exhibition Designer. One category of deliverables for the exhibition was social media graphics. I gathered a list of social media platforms that the PMA and UWF both had accounts with and designed graphics and posts for those platforms. I created traditional square posts, banners, as well as carousel posts, and animations for Instagram and Facebook stories.
