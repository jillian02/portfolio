        <h3>68th Annual Youth Art Focus</h3>
    
    <h2>
        While working with the <a href="https://pensacolamuseum.org/" class="external">Pensacola Museum of Art</a> as a client during my internship, I was in charge of designing the exhibition identity of the <a href="https://pensacolamuseum.org/art/68th-annual-youth-art-focus/" class="external">68th Annual Youth Art Focus exhibit</a>. Youth Art Focus is an annual juried exhibition in partnership with Escambia County School District and the PMA Guild showcasing all Escambia County School art classes. Youth Art Focus is an opportunity to immerse students in visual culture and provide a platform for our community to engage with Escambia County’s art education programs. For the design of the title wall, I was only given one requirement on the basis of budgeting: I had to include an acrylic and vinyl piece from the previous year’s title wall. In the digital rendering, this piece is a dark purple shape with a text overlay.
