        <h3> 68th Annual Youth Art Focus </h3>
    
    <h2>
        While working with the <a href="https://pensacolamuseum.org/" class="external" target="_blank">Pensacola Museum of Art</a> as a client during my internship, I was in charge of designing the exhibition identity of the <a href="https://pensacolamuseum.org/art/68th-annual-youth-art-focus/" class="external" target="_blank">68th Annual Youth Art Focus exhibit</a>. Youth Art Focus is an annual juried exhibition in partnership with Escambia County School District and the PMA Guild showcasing all Escambia County School art classes. Youth Art Focus is an opportunity to immerse students in visual culture and provide a platform for our community to engage with Escambia County’s art education programs. To keep within the budget I also proposed that other title wall elements either be made of foam and cut with the in-house CNC machine or be made of vinyl adhesive printed and cut in-house. The scale of the title wall had to allow room for one school’s artwork beside it. The placement had to be high enough on the wall for the centerline to lie at eye level - or about 58 inches from the floor.
