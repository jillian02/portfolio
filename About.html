        <h3> Hi there, I'm Jillian!</h3>
    
    <h2>
        Currently, I am a graphic design student at The University of West Florida. I have been studying graphic and digital design for three years now. However, I have enjoyed creating art my whole life, no matter the media. In my personal work, I love incorporating fun new colors into designs and illustrations. My favorite art style is mid-century modern, but I am always drawn back to the use of color in fauvist art. In my internship with UWF’s 2022 TAG Student Designs Team, I have been able to work on refining my skills by designing exhibition identities and campaigns with clients like the Pensacola Museum of Art, Pensacola’s Historic Trust, and The University of West Florida’s Art Gallery. Currently, my favorite design program is Adobe Illustrator, and the newest program I’m learning is Adobe Animate. </h2>
