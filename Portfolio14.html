        <h3>In Place: Faculty Exhibition</h3>
    
    <h2>
        The first experience I had working with a client during my internship was with the <a href="https://uwf.edu/cassh/departments/art-and-design/art-gallery/" class="external">University of West Florida Art Gallery</a>. Each year the school’s Department of Art and Design presents a faculty exhibition. The faculty exhibition for 2021 was the first exhibition the gallery held since its closing due to COVID-19. I was partnered with another student in my internship to design the exhibition identity for the 2021 Faculty Exhibition under the supervision of the UWF Art Gallery Director. There were no preexisting concepts for the exhibition so my partner and I worked through brainstorming a title and concept for approval. In the context of this show being the first exhibition since COVID, we decided on a title of “In Place” to question what it meant to be quarantined in place and signify that the art gallery is an artist’s place. My partner designed the title wall and we worked together with gallery assistants to paint the title wall for the exhibition.
