        <h3>Synthesis BFA Exit Show</h3>
    
    <h2>
        Two of the clients I had during my internship were the <a href="https://pensacolamuseum.org/" class="external">Pensacola Museum of Art</a> and the <a href="https://uwf.edu/cassh/departments/art-and-design/art-gallery/" class="external">University of West Florida Art Gallery</a>. Each fall and spring semester, the PMA and UWF Art Galleries come together to present SynThesis, a group BFA Exit Exhibition. I was paired with another student in the internship to design the exhibition identities for the 2021 fall SynThesis 2022 spring SynThesis. I was under the direction of the PMAâ€™s Director, Chief Curator, and Exhibition Designer. I designed the front of the postcard to be a version of the approved exhibition title wall my partner and I designed. The logotype on the postcard is directly from the title wall, but I added a gradient reversed from the logo fill to reduce negative space.
